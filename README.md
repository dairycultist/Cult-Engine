# Cult-Engine
A work-in-progress multiplayer sandbox game with server-side modding support.

## Goals
- [x] Multiplayer (server-client sockets, packets)
- [ ] 3D rendering from assets sent by the server
- [ ] Player control which is mirrored to all other clients via the server
- [ ] Publish a playtest on itch.io to get feedback and motivation to continue working on it
- [ ] Custom maps, entities, items, all of which are scriptable

## Notes
fat wife and booby wife mod

like roblok or gmod

I wish I was less worrisome and perfectionistic

this game would have everything I like: C, 3D modeling, hot women, friends

modding is solely server-side, but the server has a lot of control over the client, like hytale
